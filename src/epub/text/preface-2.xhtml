			<p>The first idea of this Romance was suggested by the story of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Santon Barsisa</i>, related in The Guardian.⁠—The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Bleeding Nun</i> is a tradition still credited in many parts of Germany; and I have been told that the ruins of the Castle of Lauenstein, which She is supposed to haunt, may yet be seen upon the borders of Thuringia.⁠—<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Water-King</i>, from the third to the twelfth stanza, is the fragment of an original Danish Ballad⁠—And <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Belerma and Durandarte</i> is translated from some stanzas to be found in a collection of old Spanish poetry, which contains also the popular song of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Gayferos and Melesindra</i>, mentioned in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Don Quixote</i>.⁠—I have now made a full avowal of all the plagiarisms of which I am aware myself; but I doubt not, many more may be found, of which I am at present totally unconscious.</p>
